	- Surviving the Death of Tungsten - Stage Expo 3233
		- The development and popularity of LED fixtures can be a threat to community owned and smaller school venues as they stop being able to use their tungsten lighting systems because they can no longer buy the lamps. There is a threat that the lighting industry will lose an entry point into interest in “backstage". As lighting has become more "digital", with higher expectations, it is no longer something easily available to non-professionals, and instead venues contract a professional. And often the professional has little time even to show the community theatre people and students anything about what they are doing. This is one of the many informal "chat" sessions being presented at the International Hub in the Network Nexus Booth #3233 on the Expo floor.

	- Qualitative Methods for Understanding Load Paths in the Theatre
		- The actions of actors, the weight of scenery and the forces of mechanical effects result in loads that push, pull and twist structures and frames whose job it is to resist those actions. These actions must follow a load path, from initiation to resolution, to ensure stability. Technical directors, technicians and designers must understand the load path to ensure that their system behaves in a predictable fashion, both in terms of stability and strength. This session will provide qualitative methods for visualization of load paths to help the TD, designer or technician understand how forces resolve to stability and to assist them in identifying areas of concern for both stability and strength. This will be a hands-on session; participants will examine load path and stability problems in small groups and describe their understanding of system behavior for each example problem. Presented by the Engineering Commission.
